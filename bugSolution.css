The correct approach is to avoid subtracting percentages directly within the `calc()` function.  Instead, calculate the pixel value beforehand, or use a different approach entirely, depending on your layout requirements. For example, if you want an element to be 50% of the container's width minus 10% of the container's width, you would calculate that percentage first to arrive at a fixed pixel value.  If you intend to subtract 10 pixels, use `calc(50% - 10px);`.  If you need a more complex calculation, break it down into simpler steps or use JavaScript to handle the dynamic calculations.
