The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly with percentage values, leading to unexpected results.  For example: `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 10%);` may not produce the intended layout.  The issue is that percentages in `calc()` are relative to the containing element's computed width, which may not be directly related to the percentage used in the calculation itself. This can lead to unpredictable results and layout issues.
